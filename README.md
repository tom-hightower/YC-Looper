# YC-Looper
Looper add-on designed with the Yamaha YC88 in mind, but compatible with anything that has an audio output. It can also be built as a standalone unit with input/output jacks or as an effects pedal with minimal modification.

## Hardware

YC Looper is powered by a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller with the [Teensy Audio Adapter](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy3_audio.html) daughterboard and a custom pcb (design files to be added) for signal routing, mounting of select components, and power management.

The following components are used, but most can easily be swapped out depending on aesthetic preference and what you may already have available:
